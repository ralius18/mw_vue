reach\nThat was before the day I knew you felt the same\nSo take my hand and we can escape\n\nYou are the one who makes things right\nJust take me away\nFor one more night\nCan you be my light?\n\nCan you be my light\nSo I can see within the walls of my mind\nIt makes no difference, with eyes open or shut\nCan you be the door, show me a way\nAnd help me escape\n\nI saw you from across the street\nYou look at me\n"},{value:"yin",title:"Yin",lyrics:"Bitter bile bleached my bones, I understand I can't be your home\nAnd I will play okay, to keep your mind at ease\nBecause your peace is all that matters to me\n\nI'm lost between the lines of love and logic\nI'm being torn apart\n\nI know it's fine it's not the end\nEven though the shadows, they eternally extend\nI'm caught between two sides, my calm and storm\nI can't go on, I'm lost as hell\n\nI will scream my eulogy to what now must decay\nRetreat behind blades barricades, don't want to be frozen\nYou dropped me here, I won't survive\n\nI'm lost between the lines of love and logic\nI'm being torn apart\n\nI know it's fine it's not the end\nEven though the shadows, they eternally extend\nI'm caught between two sides, my calm and storm\nI can't go on, I'm lost as hell\n\nAnd if you ever hear these words\nKnow that I don't hate you\nThis is the worst part of me\nEverything you saw and could never love\nI wanna bleed and scream and end\nAnd claw myself open\nGround myself in fresh wounds\nIs that too honest to say?\nClaw myself open, ground myself in fresh wounds\nIs that too honest to say?\nIs this just way too open?\nI'll never be enough\n\nAnd you know that I'll strive\nOh god will I try\nTo find some meaning again\nAnd you know that I'll strive\nOh god will I try\nTo find some meaning again\nA reason to go on\nRotate the hourglass\nWhatever comes to pass\nI'll find some meaning again\nAnd you know that I'll strive\nOh god will I try\nTo find some meaning again\n"}]}),components:{Tabs:he.Z,MwBtn:de.Z},methods:{isMobile(){return!!/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera
